# memoryClickGame

## Overview

Clicky Game is a dynamic memory game built with React. Designed to test and enhance the player's memory, the game challenges users to click on different images without repeating any previous selection. Each correct guess increases the score, and the game resets upon a mistake, shuffling the images to present a new challenge. This project demonstrates the power of React's component-based architecture, state management, and event handling to create engaging, interactive web applications.

## Game Rules
1. The game displays a collection of images.
2. Click an image to earn points, but be careful not to click on any image more than once.
3. Each click shuffles the images presented.
4. If you click the same image twice, your score resets to zero, and the game restarts.


## Features
- React Components: Modular and reusable components to construct the UI.
- State Management: Efficiently manages the state of images and scores within the game.
- Event Handling: Responsive click events to interact with the game.
- Score Tracking: Real-time tracking of the user's current and best scores.
- Image Shuffle: Random shuffling of images upon each click to reset the game layout.
- React Hooks: Utilizes React Hooks for state and lifecycle features within functional components.
